---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an unusual game and I suggest that this list be loaded to a
text editor and searched with key words rather than print or read it.
Some items will not appear immediately, so patience is needed.  Also,
there are several places where the syntax will baffle the player.
The player must explore and make a map.  Only locations are given.
Also, one point eluded me.
