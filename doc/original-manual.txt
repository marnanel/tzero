     PROLOGUE


     A dream came to you as you tossed uneasily upon an unfamiliar bed.
     In your dream, a time-worn figure waved a scythe in slow arcs across
     your sky-blue field of vision and picked, out of thin air, letters
     from a runic alphabet.  The sky-writing from the scythe crystallized
     in icy trails as a new letter materialized with each sleeping breath
     your dream encompassed.  When the message was complete, the entire
     sky was slivered with shining icicles that spelled in full:

        "Somewhere scattered across ages and landscapes are six
         enticingly round objects that you must locate and some-
         how transport to progressively future time zones where
         they can be manipulated in a fashion that will right
         the troubled times."

     As you deciphered the message, the icicles shattered in a brittle and
     sparkling avalanche.  You tossed some more and awaited your
     awakening . . .

     This game, as originally intended, quoted extensively from the works
     of T. S. Eliot.  Faber and Faber, Ltd. of London, England denied
     permission to quote Mr. Eliot.  I hope, at some time in the future,
     they will reconsider their position.


     The layout of the maze was originally designed by Robert Abbott for
     a Martin Gardner column in "Scientific American."  My thanks to Mr.
     Abbott and Mr. Gardner for granting permission to adapt it for the
     game.  Those intrigued by the devious machinations of Mr. Abbott's
     maze may encounter similar challenges in his book, "Mad Mazes"
     published by Bob Adams, Inc., Publishers.


     Neil J. Rubenking's shareware program NAMEGRAM was used to generate
     several anagrams in the game.  Cipher fanatics and cruciverbists
     might find this program captivating.

     ADVENTURE GAMING (Sample Scenario)


     The following scenario (by the way, not from this game) gives you
     an idea of how to interact with an adventure game.  In the scenario,
     your input is preceded by >>.  The computer's response is preceded
     by :.


     :Tip of Slumbering Shale-Covered Slope

     >> DOWN

     :You slip and slide down the shale-covered slope.  You shuffle nimbly
      to waylay a fatal fall, and finally land, somewhat shell-shocked, on
      your feet.  Your brief confusion soon abates.


     :Meandering Culvert

     :You are in the V-shaped bottom of a lazy culvert that meanders
      slitheringly from west to east.

     >> NORTH

     :You are not about to attempt to scale the slippery shale-covered
      slope.  Shuffling down was quite enough.


     :Meandering Culvert

     >> LOOK

     :You are in the V-shaped bottom of a lazy culvert that meanders
      slitheringly from west to east.


     :Meandering Culvert

     >> EAST

     :You follow one branch of the culvert east and emerge into an open
      space.


     :Valley Floor

     :The slinky culvert blossoms out into a full-fledged valley floor
      here.  Trilling meadowlarks compete for your attention with sun-
      drenched flowers that sparkle with metallic hues.  Tidbits and
      junk bits of metal scraps are scattered amongst the flowers.  It
      is hard to tell flower from metal.  You are intrigued by a barred
      door blocking passage to a cave to the NW.

                                      -5-





     >> EXAMINE FLOWERS

     :There is a bronze flower, a silver flower, and a copper flower
      blossoming beneath the spring singing of the mad meadowlarks.


     :Valley Floor

     >> X COPPER FLOWER

     :The copper flower shines brightly like a lucky penny found
      face-up in the street.


     :Valley Floor

     >> INVENTORY

     :You possess the following:
        A bent fork.
        A piece of string.

     :You are wearing:
        An asexual sarong.
        A pair of dark sunglasses.


     :Valley Floor

     >> X FORK

     :The fork has two tongs and a bent handle.


     :Valley Floor

     >> DROP FORK

     :Dropped.


     :Valley Floor

     :A two-pronged fork lies here.  It's left-hand tong points NW.

     >> OPEN DOOR

     :The door is locked.


     :Valley Floor

     :A two-pronged fork lies here.  It's left-hand tong points NW.

     >> GET FORK

     :Taken.


     :Valley Floor

     >> UNLOCK DOOR

     :You must use some key or implement to unlock the barred door.


     :Valley Floor


     >> X METAL SCRAPS

     :You scour the metal with your eyes, separating the flowers from
      the chaff, and, in doing so, hone in on a bronze key glinting on
      the valley floor.

     :A bronze key glints in the sunshine here.


     :Valley Floor

     >> GET KEY

     :Taken.


     :Valley Floor

     >> I

     :You possess the following:
        A bent fork.
        A bronze key.
        A piece of string.

     :You are wearing:
        An asexual sarong.
        A pair of dark sunglasses.


     :Valley Floor

     >> PICK SILVER FLOWER

     :As you try to pick the silver flower, your hand feels as if you
      dipped it in a pond dappled by moonlight.  The petals ripple
      complainingly, part and unpart, but remain unpicked.

     :Valley Floor

     >> OPEN DOOR

     :Opened.


     :Valley Floor

     >> NW

     :You proceed into the dark embrace of an encompassing cavern.


     :Crystal Cavern

     :It is completely and utterly dark.

     >> TAKE OFF DARK SUNGLASSES

     :You are dazzled.  The sun reflected off the metal flowers on the
      valley floor enters from the SE and mixes it's bronze and gold with
      the blue, cyan, and cobalt hues radiating from stalactites hanging
      from the roof of this gigantic crystal cavern.

     :Surprisingly, it is not cold in this ice-cavern.  However, you feel
      a chill coming from the NE.

                                      -9-





     :Crystal Cavern

     >> SCORE

     :You have scored 34 out of 344 points in 82 turns.
     :You have the feeling that this is the beginning of the great
      adventure.


     :Crystal Cavern

     >> TIE STRING AROUND FINGER

     :You tie the piece of string around your finger as a reminder that
      this game is probably good enough to register.

                                     -10-





     COMMAND LINE SWITCHES


     Normally, the game runs in 384k.

     If you have memory constraints, you may run it in 256k by starting it
     up as:


             T-ZERO DISK

             This alternative accesses the text file from disk rather
             than memory and is slower.


     To start directly from a save file, type:

             T-ZERO <save-file name>


     To run in 256k, starting directly from a save file, type:

             T-ZERO DISK <save-file name>


     INPUT BUFFER


     Adventure gamers often find themselves in the situation where
     they are repeatedly retyping the same commands.  To facilitate
     command processing, an input buffer of the last ten commands
     processed is maintained.  To utilize this facility, you may
     retrieve commands in the reverse order processed by using the
     gray '-' and gray '+' keys, or if you are in cursor control
     keyboard mode (see commands KEYS, KEYBOARD, and the section
     entitled "Keyboard Layout"), the up and down arrow keys.  You
     may always retrieve the last command processed using program
     function key 3 (PF3).


     PLAYER DEFINABLE FUNCTION KEYS


     If you discover you're using a command frequently, you may equate
     it to program function keys 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  To do so, type
     PF<n> (where <n> ranges from 5 to 9) on the command line, followed
     by the command desired.  From thenceforth, that command may be
     retrieved and acted upon by depressing the equivalent program
     function key.  Typing USERKEYS will produce a summary of player
     defined keys currently in effect.

                                      -11-





     COMMANDS


     In the following command descriptions, a toggle command is
     defined as a command that changes the on/off status of a feature.
     If the feature is on, the toggle command turns it off.  If the
     feature is off, the toggle command turns it on.


     BRIEF      This is the default mode for room and location
                descriptions.  A full description of the area will
                be presented to the player the first time the room
                is entered.  Thereafter, only the room or location's
                name will appear on the screen.  Full descriptions
                can be activated by switching to the VERBOSE mode.
                This same description can be displayed for a single
                turn by simply typing LOOK.

     COLORS     If an EGA or above hardware is present, cycles through
                four pre-defined palette selections.

     COMPRESS   Changes the number of lines displayed on the screen.
     (Toggle)   If 25 lines are currently being displayed, the toggle
                switches to 43 lines if the presence of an EGA is
                detected or 50 lines if the presence of a VGA is
                detected.  If either 43 or 50 lines are being displayed,
                the toggle switches back to the default mode of 25 rows.

     CREDITS    Displays information on the games origins.  Gives
                credit and thanks to the originator's of copyrighted
                information for their permission to quote that material.
                Gives credit and thanks to the beta-testing team.
                Provides a brief background of the author.

     DOS        Shells to the DOS command level.  For those who are
                unfamiliar  with shells, this simply means that the
                game is temporarily suspended and all DOS commands are
                available to you until you type EXIT to return to the
                game.

                Why would a game have a DOS shell?  For any number of
                reasons--game related or otherwise.  For example, if
                you wish to restore a game state from a save file and
                have forgotten the name of the save file, you can shell
                to DOS and issue a DIR command to list all save files.

                Or if your game play is threatened by some unattended
                piece of PC-business impinging upon your consciousness,
                you can shell to DOS, take care of that business, and
                then return to the game without reloading it by simply
                typing EXIT at the DOS prompt.

                                     -12-





     EXITS      Displays a list of all directions leading from the current
     (PF4)      location.

     HELP(H)    Displays a list of all the commands available in the
     (PF1)      game with an abbreviated description of their function.
                The list of commands is the same as the command summary
                in this document.

     HINT       Provides the stumped adventurer with a gentle nudge
                useful in solving some puzzles.  Hints are cued to
                player location and what has been solved thus far.
                Several hints may be available to the user at each
                location, each less subtle than the previous.  The
                player is given the option of seeing only those they
                wish to see.

     HINTS      Actually, there's no such command.  Once hints are
                disabled through the NOHINTS command, they cannot be
                enabled again without restarting the game.

     INFO       Since t-zero is a shareware product, information is
                provided on registration.  This information is presented
                in this document as well.

     INVENTORY  Provides a list of items in the adventurer's possession
     (I)        at the current time.

     KEYS       There are two keyboard layouts available to the player.
     (Toggle)   For reference, these are referred to as the "directional"
     (PF2)      mode and the "cursor control" mode.  (Summaries of the
                effect of depressing a particular key under each layout
                is summarized in the section entitled "Keyboard Layout").
                In general, directional mode interprets the arrow keys
                and the numeric key pad as designating compass directions
                for the player to travel (for example, the right arrow
                is equivalent to East).  Cursor control mode utilizes
                the keys for command line editing. The KEYS command
                switches between keyboard modes.  If you are in cursor
                control mode, it switches to directional mode.  If you
                are in directional mode, it switches to cursor control
                mode which is the default mode.  If you are unsure what
                keyboard mode you're in or wish to see what editing
                commands are available to you, typing KEYBOARD will let
                you know.

     KEYBOARD   Reveals what keyboard layout you're using (either
                directional or cursor control) and presents a summary
                of the keystroke functions in that mode.  This summary
                is the same as presented in this document in the section
                entitled "Keyboard Layout."

     LOG        Sometimes it might be convenient to review the game's
     (Toggle)   prose without actually playing the game (or you might be
                so taken with the prose you want a permanent copy!).
                To log all text displayed on the screen to the file
                T-ZERO.SCR, type LOG.  To turn off this feature, type
                LOG again.  If the file T-ZERO.SCR does not exist, it is
                created.  If it exists, new text is appended to the old
                file.

     MORE       Normally, if an action by the player triggers the
     (Toggle)   display of more than a full screen of text, the display
                will pause at each screen and the word MORE> will appear
                in the lower right hand corner of the screen.  The
                player can then pause, read the text leisurely, and then
                "hit any key to continue."  However, if you are replaying
                a portion of the game or are using the FIND command to
                navigate between far-flung locations, you can suppress
                this courteous pause by typing MORE.  You can return to
                the screen pause default by typing MORE once again (this
                is a toggle).  It is recommended that you stick to the
                default mode unless you are replaying a portion of the
                game.  Otherwise, an important clue might scroll by you
                without allowing itself to be read.  Of course, unread
                herrings would zip by as well.

     NOHINTS    The temptation to use the hint file may be strong for
                some to resist.  The intrepid adventurer may therefore
                wish to kill the hint file for the duration of the
                game.  To do so, type NOHINTS.  Once this command is
                issued, it is no longer possible to use the HINT command
                and you can't retreat to hint mode without restarting
                the game.

     QUIT       This command quits the game (after first displaying
     (Q)        your score and rank) and returns you to the DOS command
                level.

     RESTART    Recreates the initial state of the game.  This is a
                convenient way to start over without quitting and
                reloading t-zero.

     RESTORE    Returns the game (from the supplied save file name) to
                the state it was in when the save file was created.  If
                no save file name is supplied, the default T-ZERO.SAV
                is used.

     REVISIONS  Presents a brief version history of the game and
                indicates what changes have been incorporated into
                each version.

     SAVE       You've had a hard day on the play field and want to
                quit or you want to experiment with certain potentially
                disastrous actions.  You can save the state of the game
                by typing SAVE.  You will be prompted for a file name.
                If you supply none, the default is T-ZERO.SAV.  To
                return to this saved state, type RESTORE and supply
                the corresponding save file name when prompted.

     SCORE      No, this command doesn't increment your score but it
                does display your score and a brief verbal tag
                indicating your "rank."

     SCRIPT     Produces a hard copy of the game's prose on the
     (Toggle)   printer.  This hard copy echoes the screen display.
                Typing SCRIPT once more will suppress further printing.

     SOUND      Normally, when you score, you're made aware of the
     (Toggle)   fact by an audio beep (or charge or whatever you want
                to call it).  As a courtesy to others in your "play
                vicinity," you may wish to suppress this audio signal.
                Typing SOUND will suppress the beep.  Typing SOUND
                again will bring it back on.

     SPACE      To improve readability, logical chunks of prose are
     (Toggle)   double-spaced.  If you wish to cram more on a screen,
                you can single-space screen output by typing SPACE.
                Typing SPACE once more will return you to double-
                spaced screen output.  SPACE also effects text being
                echoed to the printer through the SCRIPT command.

     TIME       Tells time in terms of the clock in the game's universe
     (WHEN)     (Alt-T) displays a time window in terms of the real
                world's time.  This is included for players who get so
                immersed in the game they need a reality check.

     UNDO       Oops!  I didn't mean to do that!  You can undo the
     (OOPS)     effect of a bad or disastrous action by typing UNDO.
                This, in effect, returns the game to the state it was
                in before the turn was taken.  Certain commands, such
                as those summarized in this list, can't be undone.
                And, of course, if you want to UNDO an UNDO command,
                simply redo what you undid (Clear?).

     USERKEYS   Produces a summary of player defined function keys
                currently in effect.  See the section entitled "Player
                Definable Function Keys" for an explanation of how
                to equate a key with a command.

     VERBOSE    Normally, a room's description is only presented upon
                first encountering (or first illuminating) that
                location.  To display the full room description every
                time you reenter a room, type VERBOSE.  To return to
                the default mode, type BRIEF.

     SHAREWARE INFORMATION


     Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before
     buying it.  If you try a Shareware program and continue using it,
     you are expected to register.  Individual programs differ on details--
     some request registration while others require it, some specify a
     maximum trial period.  With registration, you get anything from the
     simple right to continue using the software to an updated program
     with printed manual.

     Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and
     the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions
     as stated below (see "Warranty Information").  Shareware authors are
     accomplished programmers, just like commercial authors, and the
     programs are of comparable quality (in both cases, there are good
     programs and bad ones!).  The main difference is in the method of
     distribution.  The author specifically grants the right to copy and
     distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific
     group.  For example, some authors require written permission before
     a commercial disk vendor may copy their Shareware.

     Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.  You
     should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether
     it's commercial or Shareware.  The Shareware system makes fitting
     your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.  And because
     the overhead is low, prices are low also.  Shareware has the ultimate
     money-back guarantee--if you don't use the product, you don't pay for
     it.


     ASP OMBUDSMAN STATEMENT

        "This program is produced by a member of the Association
         of Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure
         that the shareware principle works for you.  If you are
         unable to resolve a shareware-related problem with an ASP
         member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able
         to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute
         or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide
         technical support for members' products.  Please write to
         the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442-

     WARRANTY INFORMATION

     Users of t-zero must accept this disclaimer of warranty:

        "t-zero is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all
         warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation,
         the warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
         The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or conse-
         quential, which may result from the use of t-zero."

     t-zero is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to the
     user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends, but
     please do not give it away altered or as part of another system.

     The following files must be included in any distributed copy:

        T-ZERO.EXE
        T-ZERO.DAT
        T-0.DAT
        DOCUMENT.T-0
        REGISTER.ME
        HINT.DAT

     (beginning with V1.04, the hint file is included in both registered
      and unregistered versions).


     The essence of "user-supported" software is to provide personal
     computer users with quality software without high prices, and yet
     to provide incentive for programmers to continue to develop new
     products.  If you find this game enjoyable and find that you are
     playing t-zero and continue to play t-zero after a reasonable trial
     period, you must make a registration payment of $20.00 to the author.

     The $20.00 registration fee will license one copy for use on any one
     computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like
     a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any number
     of people and may be freely moved from one computer location to
     another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used at one
     location while it's being used at another.  Just as a book cannot
     be read by two different persons at the same time.

     Anyone distributing t-zero for any kind of remuneration must first
     contact the author at the address below for authorization.  This
     authorization will be automatically granted to distributors
     recognized by the (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for shareware
     distributors, and such distributors may begin offering t-zero
     immediately (However the author must still be advised so that the
     distributor can be kept up-to-date with the latest version of t-zero.).

                                     -25-





     You are encouraged to pass a copy of t-zero along to your
     friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their
     copy if they find that they can use it.  All registered players
     will receive a copy of the latest version of t-zero.

     REGISTRATION INFORMATION


     Registered users will receive a disk containing the most recent
     version of t-zero.  If your version number has changed, save
     files may not be compatible between the two versions.  The cover
     letter accompanying the registered version will indicate which
     versions have compatible save files.  Those of you who wish,
     will also be sent a complete walk-thru detailing a step-by-step
     solution to the game and a diagram that maps the maze.

     To register, send $20.00 (check or money order) + $2.00 (shipping
     and handling--total $22.00) and the attached registration form to:

     SUPPORT POLICY

     The author will willingly track down and correct any reported bugs
     and create a new version to correct them.  He has been known to
     provide gentle nudges that go where no hints have gone before.

     He also provide telephone, E-Mail, and mail support.  Prior to
     5:00 PM, Pacific Time, a voice-messaging system will take your
     query (he cannot return long-distance calls but will get back
     to you by mail).  After 5:00 PM, you may talk directly to the
     author.

     Even if you decide not to register, your comments are always welcome.
     Thanks for your interest in the game.  A new one is already in the works!


     HINTS

     It's easy to get stuck!  I do it all the time.  Contacting fellow
     players is a good way to edge your way past roadblocks.  Different
     players seem to bog down in different places.  I would recommend
     the following boards for assistance:

         GO GAMERS on CompuServe.
         SCORPIA bulletin board on GEnie.
         Computer Club, Adventure Games, L-Z on Prodigy.

     In particular, a large number of players on Prodigy have completed
     the game and are always willing to lend a hand.
