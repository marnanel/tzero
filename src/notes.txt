The status line looks like this:

  River Bed.                 6:00AM * Day 1 * Present * 0/0
  ^ left aligned             ^ right aligned

The "*"s are square bullets.
A move takes five minutes (always?)
There is no indication of the direction of time flow.
The first of the final pair of numbers is the score;
the second is the number of moves.
